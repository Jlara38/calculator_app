Flutter Calculator App

## Getting Started

This Project is a simple calculator app with a simple UI/UX design.
Completely meant to just do the one thing it was desinged to be which is a
Calculator.

Note: As of right now the app is done being made. However, this does not mean im done.
I do intend to expand this app even further potentially adding some unit conversion capabilities 
in the near future.
